## About the Project

This project was a challange to put my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript at
test. I've learned a lot!

## How to Play

* Clone the [Game](https://github.com/cpofsw/fend-project-memory-game).
* Clicking on the cards will turn them over.
* Find the matching cards.
* Try to match all the cards with the minimum tries possible for a higher score.
